# Deaths Caused by Bad Air Quality (SDG Indicator 11.6.2)

## Overview  
This project investigates the correlation between the Air Quality Index (AQI) and global mortality rates from air pollution between 1990 and 2019.  
It uses **two complementary Power BI dashboards**: one focused on **data visualizations** and another containing **text-based analysis** (Introduction, EDA, Findings, Discussion, Conclusion).  

## Dashboards  
1. **AQI_Deaths_Visuals.pbix**  
   - Contains interactive visualizations:  
     - Global deaths by country (bar charts, maps)  
     - Decadal shifts in mortality (1990 vs 2019)  
     - Country-specific drilldowns  
     - Correlation analysis (scatter plots, R ≈ 0.70)  

2. **AQI_Deaths_Text.pbix**  
   - Contains the written analysis structured as:  
     - Introduction & Research Question  
     - Exploratory Data Analysis  
     - Findings (with commentary on visualizations)  
     - Discussion (interpretation, limitations, CRISP-DM steps)  
     - Conclusion (policy implications, future directions)  

## Data Sources  
- [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/830953/deaths-due-to-air-pollution-in-major-countries/) — air pollution mortality by country  
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azminetoushikwasif/aqi-air-quality-index-scheduled-daily-update) — daily AQI datasets  
- [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228) — Global Air Quality Guidelines  

## Key Insights  
- Strong positive correlation between AQI levels and mortality (~0.70).  
- China, India, and Bangladesh show the highest combined AQI and death rates.  
- Decadal analysis indicates worsening mortality outcomes consistent with industrial growth.  

## Skills & Tools  
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation and storytelling  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for cleaning and transforming data  
- **Data Visualization** (maps, bar charts, scatter plots)  
- **Correlation & trend analysis**  

## How to Use  
- Open either `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.  
- Start with **AQI_Deaths_Text.pbix** to read the structured report.  
- Use **AQI_Deaths_Visuals.pbix** to interact with the data and explore trends.
